<h2>A simple calculator in PHP</h2>
A simple calculator in PHP is a web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and display the result. The application consists of two parts: a HTML form and a PHP script.
<h2>The HTML form</h2>
The HTML form provides the user interface for entering the numbers and choosing the operator. The HTML form contains:

Two input fields for entering the numbers, with names num1 and num2
- A dropdown menu for selecting the operator, with name op
- A submit button for sending the data to calculator.php
The form uses POST method to send data to calculator.php.
<h2>The PHP script</h2>
The PHP script processes the user input and performs the calculation based on the operator. The PHP script:

- Receives the data from the form using $_POST superglobal array
- Assigns them to variables $num1, $num2, and $op
- Uses a switch statement to perform different calculations based on the value of $op
